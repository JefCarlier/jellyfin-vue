  Overview:
    'Sounds of Silence is the second album by Simon and Garfunkel, released on January 17, 1966. The album\'s title is a slight modification of the title of the duo\'s first major hit, "The Sound of Silence," which originally was released as "The Sounds of Silence". The song had earlier been released in an acoustic version on the album Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., and later on the soundtrack to the movie The Graduate. Without the knowledge of Simon and Garfunkel, electric instruments and drums were overdubbed by Bob Dylan\'s studio band on June 15, 1965. This new version was released as a single in September 1965, and opens the album.\n\n"Homeward Bound" was released on the album in the UK, placed at the beginning of Side 2 behind "Richard Cory". It was also released as part of the box set Simon & Garfunkel Collected Works, on both LP and CD. Many of the songs in the album had been written by Paul Simon while he lived in London during 1965.\n"I Am a Rock," "Leaves That Are Green," "April Come She Will," "A Most Peculiar Man," and "Kathy\'s Song" had appeared on The Paul Simon Songbook, released in August 1965 in England as had another version of the title track. "Richard Cory" was based on a poem by Edwin Arlington Robinson, "Somewhere They Can\'t Find Me" was essentially a rewrite of the previous album\'s "Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M." and "Anji" was an instrumental piece that Simon had picked up, presumably in London, from guitarist Davey Graham. Hence the only brand new Paul Simon compositions on the album were "Blessed" and "We\'ve Got a Groovy Thing Goin\'".',
